    Simple questionnaires only need simple behavior.  The order of the questions is fixed, all of them get displayed and the only controls that need to be
    specified are what the types of the questions are, whether a group or the answers to a question repeats, and whether a group or a question must be
    answered.  However, for more sophisticated forms, there may be a need to set default answers, to enforce rules around the allowed answers (such as length,
    size, types of references), and/or to make the behavior of the questionnaire dynamic based on previous answers.  The FHIR specification provides core
    elements that allow some of these things, and common extensions for others.  This implementation guide supplements the core FHIR specification with additional extensions.
    It also defines the <a href="sdc-questionnaire-behave.html">sdc-questionnaire-behave</a> profile to highlight what extensions are available and where they are
    intended to be used.  It also identifies specific 'must support' extensions that systems that claim to support SDC rendering SHALL be capable of authoring
    and/or rendering, as befits the CapabilityStatement(s) they claim conformance to.

  <h3>Element and  Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The following sub-sections describe the different core elements and extensions available to control the 'behavior' of a questionnaire.
    Each extension includes the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Code:</b> This is the name of the core element or the unique label for the extension.  The extension label appears at the end of the URL of the
      'source' (below).  In this implementation guide, extensions are generally just referred to by their code.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Source:</b> This will either be 'N/A', 'Core', 'Questionnaire' or 'SDC'.  'N/A' indicates that the element is part of the core spec, not an extension.
      'Core' indicates that the extension is defined in the core specification and is not
      specific to the Questionnaire resource.  The base URL for 'core' extensions is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/</code>.  Questionnaire
      indicates an extension defined in the core specification that is specific to Questionnaires.  The base URL for 'Questionnaire' extensions is
      <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-</code>.  SDC extensions are defined within this implementation guide.  Their base URL
      is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Location:</b> This indicates where the element or extension can appear.  Possible values are 'root' (for those that appear directly on the
      <code>Questionnaire</code> element), 'item' (for those that can appear on any type of item) or 'question' for those that can only appear on question
      items.  In some cases, additional restrictions/guidance will be provided</li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Type:</b> Indicates what content the element or extension can have.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Both core elements and extensions will have explanatory text that provides additional guidance on how the extension is used.

    These elements all constrain the allowed values for answers to Questionnaires.

            This core element is typically used with strings, but can theoretically be used for other variable-length simple types (e.g. to limit the maximum
            precision of a 'time' element).  It SHALL NOT be used for complex types such as choice, open-choice, quantity, attachment or reference.  It establishes
            the maximum length of the answer in characters.  Be aware that in UTF-8, some characters may take multiple bytes, so maxLength does not place a
            specific constraint on the maximum number of bytes.  If not specified, the maximum length is established by the data type.  (For example, in FHIR

            simple types, not choice, open-choice, quantity, attachment or reference.  It is typically used on strings to help ensure a minimum amount of detail
            is provided.  However, it can also be used to set a minimum precision for variable-length types such as date or time.  E.g. to enforce that a date
            includes at least the year and month, the minimum length could be set to 7.

            This allows constraining the allowed value for a question item's answer to an enumerated set.  Each answerOption repetition indicates one of the
            possible allowed values.  The answer to the question, if answered, SHALL match one of the specified repetitions unless the item.type is
            open-choice. The type of the answerOption must match the type of the question. (Coding is used for both choice and open-choice.)
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two mechanisms to enumerate the permitted answers for a question: this element and the <a href="#answerValueSet">answerValueSet</a>
            element.  answerValueSet only supports defining values for 'string' and Coding elements.  (For 'string', the allowed values are those found in
            the value set expansion's 'code' elements.)  However, it allows for the set of allowed codes to be maintained as an expression such as "all
            medications from SNOMED CT", automatically adjusting as the set of matching codes changes based on the evolution of the code system.  As such,
            answerValueSet is appropriate when the set of codes is large or potentially dynamic and enumerating all the possible choices within the
            Questionnaire doesn't make sense.  To have tighter control of the set of answers allowed for the question, consider making the reference to the
            ValueSet <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#canonical">version-specific</a>.  To really lock down the set of codes, the value
            set should itself tie itself to specific versions of the underlying code systems and/or specify a
            <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.lockedDate">lockedDate</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>answerValueSet</code> also allows for the possibility of sharing a set of answers across multiple questions within a single Questionnaire.
            Sharing the set of allowed answers simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency across questions.  This can be important when representing
            choices as columns or rows in a table (see <a href="rendering.html#itemControl">itemControl</a>.  If appropriate, the ValueSet can be nested
            inside the Questionnaire as a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#contained">contained</a> resource.  This should only be done if
            the ValueSet is intrinsically tied to the Questionnaire and should only ever be edited in the context of the Questionnaire.  Such ValueSets will
            not be available for use elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>answerOption</code> works well when there is a small (2 - 20ish) number of choices.  It's the only option if the question type is integer,
            date, time or reference.  The set of options is maintained independently for each question.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>answerOption</code> and <code>answerValueSet</code> are mutually exclusive.  They SHALL NOT appear together on the same question.  If
            <code>answerOption</code> appears, there SHOULD be more than one repetition of it.  A question with a single answerOption will be treated as
            having a single fixed value.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the set of choices is restricted using either <code>answerOption</code> or <code>answerValueSet</code>, the use of any other
            <a href="#value-constraint">Value Constraint</a> elements is redundant and confusing.  Therefore, questions that have either 'answerOption' or
            'answerValueSet' SHALL NOT make use of any of the other Value Constraint extensions.

            The <a href="#required">required</a> element allows distinguishing items that are optional (minOccurs=0) from those that are required (minOccurs=1).
            However, for elements where <a href="#repeats">repeats</a> is true, it's sometimes necessary to indicate that multiple repetitions are required.
            For example, a question might ask the user to "select your top 3 choices" and want to enforce that at least 3 choices had been chosen.  The
            minOccurs extension allows such rules to be enforced.  Using the <a href="#cqf-calculatedValue">cqf-calculatedValue</a> extension, the minimum
            number of repetitions can also be made dynamic.  For example, one question might ask "How many brothers and sisters did you have?" while a
            subsequent repeating group captures information about each sibling.  The Questionnaire could enforce that the number of group repetitions matched the
            number of siblings indicated by setting minOccurs and <a href="#maxOccurs">maxOccurs</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This element SHALL only be set for an item where both <a href="#required">required</a> and <a href="#repeats">repeats</a> are true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that, depending on <a href="#entryMode">entryMode</a>, users may be able to 'skip' questions that do not meet the minimum number of
            repetitions and come back to them later.  However, the status of a QuestionnaireResponse SHALL NOT change to 'completed' until all enabled
            items have their minOccurs requirement met.

            support the listed profile(s).  Thus, a fallback to evaluating candidates against the profile(s) and filtering the list to exclude those that
            are not should also be supported.  More sophisticated querying is supported by the <a href="#referenceFilter">referenceFilter</a> extension.

            This serves the same purpose as <a href="#enableWhen">enableWhen</a> (and is mutually exclusive with it).  It controls whether an item should be
            'enabled' or not, but can handle more sophisticated circumstances than that extension.  (If enableWhen can meet the need, it should be used
            instead as it will be more broadly supported.)  Specifically, enableWhenExpression allows more complex logic such as a mixture of 'and' and 'or' relationships
            amongst conditions (e.g. "Enable if Q1=5 and either Q2 or Q3 are true").  It also allows for logic to be based on calculations across questions
            (possibly leveraging <a href="#variable">variable</a>) or even based on values passed in by <a href="#launchContext">launchContext</a> or
            queried from outside the questionnaire (see <a href="expressions.html">Using Expressions</a>.

            This extension is similar to <a href="#enableWhen">enableWhen</a> in that it enables or disables elements within the Questionnaire.  However,
            rather than being driven by data within the form or queried or passed from outside, it is instead driven by how the QuestionnaireResponse is
            being used.  Specifically, it allows certain elements to be enabled or disabled based on whether the form is being completed or whether it's
            being rendered after being completed.  When being rendered after completion, it also allows questions and groups to be suppressed if they are
            'empty'.  For example, the extension might hide data entry instructions when displaying a completed form and might hide 'interpretation'
            instructions when performing data entry.  It might also hide a score during data entry, but make it visible once the form is ready to be reviewed.

            This allows assertion of constraints across an entire questionnaire or across any item with child items.  For example, it could be used to
            require that either the patient identifier or birth date must be specified, that at least 6 of the questions from question 10 through 20
            must be answered, or that the sum of questions 1 through 5 must equal exactly 100.  The human field SHOULD be set to inform the user what to do.

            This allows a form to indicate whether the form must be signed on completion or whether specified questions or answers themselves must be signed.
            Signature can be as simple as providing the user's initials to confirm that they've verified and agree with the answer, or it could mean a
            full digital signature.  This extension will tend to be used on Questionnaires that result in legal documents.

            occasionally might have a value of 1, the answer of weekly 2 and daily 4.  The answer given would then be incorporated in an overall risk
